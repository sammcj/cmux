If it outputs anything or has timing issues with the async git status, could cause double renders\n\n4. **Line wrapping + resize**: Long prompt wrapping then getting redrawn at different width could leave the trailing `#` character as an artifact\n\n5. **Connection timing**: Terminal connects while shell is mid-prompt-output, causing partial characters to be captured\n\n## Relevant files\n- `src/mux/terminal.rs` - Virtual terminal emulator\n- `src/mux/grid.rs` - Grid resize handling\n- `src/bubblewrap.rs:419` - zsh PROMPT definition with vcs_info","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-03T18:37:04.803472-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-03T18:40:33.119309-08:00"}

{"id":"sandbox-b7d","title":"Sync user's neovim/lazyvim config to sandbox","description":"## Problem\nSupport syncing user's nvim configuration (including lazyvim) to sandboxes without slowing down initial creation time.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Lazyvim directory structure:\n- ~/.config/nvim - Config files, lua scripts, lazy-lock.json (~100KB-1MB)\n- ~/.local/share/nvim - Plugins installed by lazy.nvim (~500MB-2GB!)\n- ~/.local/state/nvim - State files (~small)\n- ~/.cache/nvim - Compiled lua, treesitter parsers (~100MB+)\n\n### Options considered:\n\n**1. Background sync after sandbox ready**\n- Start sandbox without nvim configs, sync in background\n- Con: User might try nvim before sync completes\n\n**2. Volume mount from host**\n- Mount ~/.config/nvim as read-only volume\n- Con: Security concerns, sandbox isolation breaks\n\n**3. Pre-baked image with nvim distributions**\n- Include lazyvim/nvchad in Docker image\n- Con: Large image, not personalized, version mismatches\n\n**4. Smart differential sync**\n- Cache tarball locally, only re-create if changed\n- Con: First run still slow\n\n**5. Config-only sync (RECOMMENDED)**\n- Only sync ~/.config/nvim (~1MB, fast)\n- Let lazy.nvim download plugins on first nvim launch\n- Pro: Small sync, always fresh plugins, personalized config\n- Con: First nvim launch triggers plugin install (~1-2min)\n\n**6. Hybrid with shared plugin volume**\n- Sync config, share plugin volume across sandboxes\n- Pro: Fast after first sandbox ever\n- Con: Complex, plugin conflicts possible\n\n## Recommendation\nStart with option 5 (config-only sync):\n1. Add ~/.config/nvim to sync_files detection\n2. Upload during sandbox creation (adds \u003c1s)\n3. First nvim launch triggers lazy.nvim plugin sync\n\nFuture enhancement: Create shared nvim plugin cache volume.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-02T17:19:51.204711-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-02T17:20:19.542345-08:00"}
